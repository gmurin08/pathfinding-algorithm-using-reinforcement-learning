# pathfinding-algorithm-using-reinforcement-learning

## Summary
In this assignment, we were tasked with creating the code that would allow an intelligent agent to traverse the graph in the most efficient way possible. 
the underlying data structures were given including the neural network and the graph. Our challenge was to utilize these structures in order to facilitate the process.

## Connections 

Computer scientists are tasked with finding new and innovative solutions for problems that can be solved using technology. With the advent of artificial technology,
this domain is ever increasing and thus new innovations continue to be made by computer scientists through the use of AI and by other means. The nature of this job is 
important in that it can directly affect the lives of millions of people. For instance, AI and other technologies when applied to the field of medicine could potentially
save lives and increase quality of life. As a compuiter scientist, I approach a problem by breaking it down into its simplest principles and deducing possible solutions 
based on information gained through intuition and furhter investigation. My ethical responsibilities surrounding the handling and analysis of data include the idea of informed 
consent which is to say that those from which I collect and interpret data should consent to the collection and know what I'm doing with the data. I also must ensure that data
collected is free of any potential biases that could affect the outcome of analyses.
